Container is based on alpine linux with s6 overlay, for shell access whilst the container is running use the console button in the GUI or use the console sub-command in the CLI.

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" ™.

## Setting up the application

Access WebUI at `<your-ip>:8181` and walk through the wizard.
