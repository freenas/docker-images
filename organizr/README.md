HTPC/Homelab Services Organizer - Written in PHP

[![organizr](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxserver/docker-templates/master/linuxserver.io/img/organizr-icon.png)][appurl]

## Parameters

`The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side. 
For example with a port -p external:internal - what this shows is the port mapping from internal to external of the container.
So -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080
http://192.168.x.x:8080 would show you what's running INSIDE the container on port 80.`

* `-p 80` - the port(s)
* `-v /config` - config files for organizr
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation

It is based on alpine linux with s6 overlay, for shell access whilst the container is running do `docker exec -it organizr /bin/bash`.

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Setting up the application

Setup accounts etc via the webui, more info at [Organizr][appurl].

## Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it organizr /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f organizr`
