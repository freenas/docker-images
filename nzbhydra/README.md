# linuxserver/hydra with FreeNAS metadata

NZBHydra is a meta search for NZB indexers and the "spiritual successor" to NZBmegasearcH. It provides easy access to a number of raw and newznab based indexers. [hydra](https://github.com/theotherp/nzbhydra)

## Parameters

`The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side. 
For example with a port -p external:internal - what this shows is the port mapping from internal to external of the container.
So -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080
http://192.168.x.x:8080 would show you what's running INSIDE the container on port 80.`


* `-p 5075` - the port(s)
* `-v /config` - Where hydra should store config files
* `-v /downloads` - NZB download folder
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation
* `-e TZ` for timezone EG. Europe/London

It is based on alpine linux with s6 overlay, for shell access whilst the container is running do `docker exec -it hydra /bin/bash`.

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Setting up the application 

The web interface is at `<your ip>:5075` , to set up indexers and connections to your nzb download applications.


## Info

* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime `docker logs -f hydra`.

* container version number 

`docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' hydra`

* image version number

`docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' linuxserver/hydra`
