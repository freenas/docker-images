Searx is a metasearch engine, inspired by the seeks project.

It provides basic privacy by mixing your queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data. Queries are made using a POST request on every browser (except chrome). Therefore they show up in neither our logs, nor your url history. In case of Chrome users there is an exception, Searx uses the search bar to perform GET requests. Searx can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as the default search engine.
