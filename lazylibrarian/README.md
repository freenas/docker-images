Container is based on alpine linux with s6 overlay, for shell access whilst the container is running use the console button in the GUI or use the console sub-command in the CLI.

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

## Setting up the application
Access the webui at `<your-ip>:5299/home`, for more information check out [LazyLibrarian][lazyurl]..
