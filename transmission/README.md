Transmission is designed to be easy to use, yet powerful. Transmission has the features you want from a BitTorrent client: encryption, a web interface, peer exchange, magnet links, DHT, µTP, UPnP and NAT-PMP port forwarding, webseed support, watch directories, tracker editing, global and per-torrent speed limits, and more.

## Usage

### Volumes:

* <path to data>:/config
where transmission should store config files and logs
* <path to downloads>:/downloads
local path for downloads
* <path to watch folder>:/watch
watch folder for torrent files

### Variables:

* PGID=<gid> 
See below for explanation
* PUID=<uid>
See below for explanation
* TZ=<timezone>
e.g. Europe/London

Ports:
* 9091:9091
* 51413:51413
* 51413:51413/udp

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes, permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" ™.

## Setting up the application 

Webui is on port 9091, the settings.json file in /config has extra settings not available in the webui. Stop the container before editing it or any changes won't be saved.

## Securing the webui with a username/password.

this requires 3 settings to be changed in the settings.json file.

`Make sure the container is stopped before editing these settings.`

`"rpc-authentication-required": true,` - check this, the default is false, change to true.

`"rpc-username": "transmission",` substitute transmission for your chosen user name, this is just an example.

`rpc-password` will be a hash starting with {, replace everything including the { with your chosen password, keeping the quotes.

Transmission will convert it to a hash when you restart the container after making the above edits.

## Updating Blocklists Automatically

This requires `"blocklist-enabled": true,` to be set. By setting this to true, it is assumed you have also populated `blocklist-url` with a valid block list.

The automatic update is a shell script that downloads a blocklist from the url stored in the settings.json, gunzips it, and restarts the transmission daemon.

The automatic update will run once a day at 3am local server time.
