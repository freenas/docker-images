## Parameters

* `8090` - the port(s)
* `/config` - where mylar should store config files
* `/downloads` - map to your downloads folder

Container is based on alpine linux with s6 overlay, for shell access whilst the container is running use the console button in the GUI or use the console sub-command in the CLI.

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

## Setting up the application

The web ui for settings etc, is on `<your-ip>:8090`
