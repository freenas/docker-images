# Introduction:

Emby Server is a home media server built on top of other popular open source
technologies such as Service Stack, jQuery, jQuery mobile, and Mono.

It features a REST-based API with built-in documention to facilitate client
development. We also have client libraries for our API to enable rapid
development.

You can upgrade the version of embyserver found within the container by executing ```sh emby-server update ```
